# Le Moyne Bootstrap Theme Prototype

This theme used Bootswatch Sandstone as a starting point, but is  quickly diverging from that starting point to become a new theme. 

The main work has been to identify colors from the LMC style guide and record them as Less variables so they can be applied through out the theme â€” e.g., to links, list items, buttons, and navigation elements. 

A Google Fonts package has also been created using the typographic recommendations of the LMC style guide. I have decided not to use the size recommendations, finding them to be too oversized to be suitable for the informational content of the LibGuides site, and will probably stick with the font sizes that Bootstrap uses for headings, paragraphs, list items, etc.
