# Le Moyne Bootstrap Theme Prototype

This theme used Bootswatch Sandstone as a starting point, but is  quickly diverging from that starting point to become a new theme. 

The main work has been to identify colors from the LMC style guide and record them as Less variables so they can be applied throughout the theme â€” e.g., to links, list items, buttons, and navigation elements. 

A Google Fonts package has also been constructed using the typographic recommendations of the LMC style guide. I have decided not to use their font size recommendations, however, finding them to be too oversized to be suitable for the informational content of the LibGuides site. Instead, I plan to stick with the font sizes that Bootstrap uses for headings, paragraphs, list items, etc.
